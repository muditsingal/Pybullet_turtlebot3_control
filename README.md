### Libraries used:
- Pybullet
- Numpy
- Time
- os

### Instructions to run:
1. Download the whole zip file and ensure the packages folder is present in the same file as the python code: tbot_lidar_obs_avoid.py
2. Modify the obstacles to observe the robot's behaviour if needed. Else, sufficient obstacles are added in the example file.
3. Run the file with python interpreter, preferably python 3.8.
4. Pybullet GUI will simulate the motion of turtlebot3 in the environment with obstacles. The robot will avoid all the obstacles.
5. You can also move the obstacles by mouse button and the robot will avoid them in real-time.
